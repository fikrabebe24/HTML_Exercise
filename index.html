      <h1>Fikrte Abebe or Fifi</h1>
  </p>
    I'm Fikrte, a full stack C# developer based out of the Metro Atlanta area.
    My passion for technology and software development was ignited in my role as a 
    funtional software implementation consultant at an atlanta based supply chain
    software company. In my role, I witnessed first hand, how technology was insturmental
    in not only facilitating, but optimizing business processes. This got me wondering
    what else software can power besides business all I wanted to do
    after that was learn to code so I can use my creative problem solving brain to build 
    all kinds of software! Hire me and lets code our creative sparks into flight!

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>," <spann id="green-text">Bredon</spann>said grandly, "is to <u>play</u> a beautiful game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a <em>beautiful</em> smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
